# The-corpus-for-eye-tracking-experiment-with-Chinese-sentence-reading-tests
The database provides tailored Chinese reading materials for eye-tracking experiments, generated by ChatGPT. It enhances cognitive function assessment by replacing high-frequency words with low-frequency ones, increasing reading difficulty.

The corpus for eye-tracking experiment with Chinese-sentence-reading-tests is a valuable resource designed to support neuroscience research in assessing cognitive function through eye-tracking experiments. This database addresses the need for reading materials with higher levels of difficulty, which is crucial for obtaining accurate and meaningful experimental outcomes. Unlike traditional manual methods of generating such texts, this database leverages the exceptional language analysis abilities of ChatGPT, a user-friendly and accessible tool.

The objective of this project is to employ ChatGPT to generate tailored Chinese reading materials specifically for eye-tracking experiments. By utilizing the vast capabilities of ChatGPT, the database provides researchers with a reliable and efficient method of producing high-quality reading materials that are suited for assessing cognitive function.

The methodology used in this study involves the selection of appropriate sentences from Chinese literary works. The high-frequency words in these sentences are replaced with low-frequency words generated by ChatGPT. This process effectively increases the reading difficulty of the sentences, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of cognitive function during eye-tracking experiments.
